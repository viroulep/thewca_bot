# WCA bot on Telegram

`@thewca_bot` on Telegram.

This bot is a very basic wrapper over the WCA website search API.

Don't remember what is the text for A7g? You want a basic profile for a competitor, or the date of a specific competition?
This bot can help you :)

It only works inline, which means you will have to start your message by mentioning it and then input some search query.
It will display search results for Persons, Competitions, and Regulations and Guidelines, clicking a result will send in the current chat the details.

It behaves exactly like the omnisearch box on the top right corner of the WCA website, maybe in the future it will have more feature.
